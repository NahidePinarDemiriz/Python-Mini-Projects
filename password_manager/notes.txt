pip install cryptography

+++ Encrypt
key + password + text to encrypt = random text
random text + key + password = text to encrypt

+++ open() and with
-Unlike open() where you have to close the file with the close() method,
the with statement closes the file for you without you telling it to.
-This is because the with statement calls 2 built-in methods behind the scene â€“ __enter()__ and __exit()__.

open() - Example

my_file = open("hello.txt")
print(my_file.read())
my_file.close()


with - Example

with open("hello.txt") as my_file:
    print(my_file.read())

+++ strip()
Remove spaces at the beginning and at the end of the string:
- Example

txt = "     banana     "

x = txt.strip()

print("of all fruits", x, "is my favorite")

Output:
of all fruits banana is my favorite

+++ tell()
Find the current file position:

- Example
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.tell())

+++ seek()
-The seek() method sets the current file position in a file stream.
-The seek() method also returns the new postion.

- Example
Change the current file position to 4, and return the rest of the line:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
f.seek(4)
print(f.readline())

+++ rstrip()
- rstrip() method removes any trailing whitespace characters, including spaces,
tabs, and newline characters from the right end of a string.

-Example

txt = "banana,,,,,ssqqqww....."

x = txt.rstrip(",.qsw")

print(x)

Output:
banana
